# Opportunity Missions

[Battletech Mod][ModTek] Adds a chance for special priority missions with custom rewards under certain preconditions.

## Details
- Spawns custom events, depending on your reputation with the MRB and some planet tags
- You can react to these events with the intention to "take the opportunity"
- This will result in the creation of a special prioritiy mission at that planet which gets added to the contract list
- These contracts will reward you extraordinarily with special gear and/or 'Mechs, sometimes bound to secondary objectives
- The contracts feature special challenges like SLDF enemies (which are salvagable in the context of an opportunity mission) or a very custom set of enemies
